Installing snake4
=================

If you don't have gcc, you'll have to edit the Makefile.  If your
compiler is not ANSI, you'll have to change all files.

  1. Make sure you have the libraries shhopt, shhmsg, xalloc and
     shhcards by the same author.  If not, you may find them at

	http://shh.thathost.com/pub-unix/

  2. Make sure you have the xpm-library.  X11 is nothing without
     this. :-)

	ftp://koala.inria.fr/pub/xpm/

  3. Edit the Makefile.  You will at least need to describe where the
     above mentioned libraries and X11 can be found.  If your game
     program group and owner is not `games', you must enter the
     appropriate names.

  4. Build the program

	make dep
	make

  5. Install program, highscore file and man-file

	make install

By default, the program will be installed in /usr/local/games, the
man-file in /usr/local/man/man6, and the highscore file will go into
/var/local/lib/games.

NOTE: The program will be installed with the SUID-bit set, to allow
editing the highscore file.  The program will refuse to run if owned
by root, for security reasons.
