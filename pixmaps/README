instructions was made using the following steps:

1. Export instrictions.fig to an xpm-file from xfig.

2. Read that xpm-file into xv, and autocrop it.

3. Save to gif-file from xv, since my version of xv failed to save
   correct xpm-files.

4. giftoppm instructions.gif | ppmtoxpm -name instructions > instructions
