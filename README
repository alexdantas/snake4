snake4 - Fruit-eating snake game
================================

This program is my fourth implementation of the snake game, written
for Unix and X11.  Previous versions were written for MS-DOS.

Move the snake around the screen and eat food.  The snake grows in
length as you eat.  Avoid hitting the fence, eating lethal mushrooms
and rotten food, and biting your own tail.

Now and then a slim-pill will bounce around.  If you eat this, you
will get shorter, and you will gain bonus points for every length you
loose.  The bonus is also given when a round is over.

When food starts blinking, it's about to rot.  Rotten food is
poisonous, and thus uneatable.  As long as it blinks, it can still be
eaten.

Oh, yes - I almost forgot: You may be visited by the evil headbanger.
Take my advice and run away from him before he hits you in the head!
He won't stay long.

Thx to brother Reidar for thinking up the slim-pill.

Choose among the following keys to move the snake around:

        ------+---+---+---+------------
	Up    | A | T | K | Up arrow
	Down  | Z | V | J | Down arrow
	Left  | N | F | H | Left arrow
	Right | M | G | L | Right arrow
        ------+---+---+---+------------

Use `space', `pause' or `p' to pause and unpause, and `esc' or `q' to
quit.

snake4 features a site-wide highscore file.  The file contains the top
200 users.  Each user may appear once only in the highscore table.
